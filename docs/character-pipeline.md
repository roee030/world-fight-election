## Integration checklist

1. Save the sheet as `assets/characters/sprite-sheets/new-roster/<id>-sheet.png`.
2. Add `<id>` to `FIGHTER_GEOMETRY` in `scripts/fighter_visual.gd` with `height_m`, `pixel_scale` and `ground_offset_m`.
3. Add `<id>` to `TWELVE_FRAME_IDS`.
4. Run `python tools/slice_sprite_sheets.py`.
5. Add the fighter data and ID to `scripts/main.gd` and `scripts/character_debug.gd`.
6. Run the Python slicing tests and all Godot tests.
7. Capture Sprite Lab, selection and combat at 1280x720. Verify visible height, feet touching the floor, direction, name fit and all twelve poses.

The slicer uses one shared scale across all poses, keeps transparent edge padding and aligns standing frames to a common foot baseline. It assigns complete connected alpha components across the full sheet instead of cropping each 4x3 cell independently, so a hand, boot, coat or accessory that crosses a grid line stays with its real pose. Remote pieces from neighbouring poses must be rejected. Do not manually stretch individual animation frames.

In Sprite Lab, trigger JAB, CROSS, KICK, GUARD, HIT, FALL, GET UP and JUMP in both directions. Every normalized frame must keep at least 99.9% of its visible alpha in the primary silhouette and keep its lowest real foot on the shared floor line.
